> Update to csv
Currently, the main script in this folder runs a speed test, and writes the results to an individual file in reports.

Can you make it towhere it outputs a row in a csv instead? Put the CSV in reports, and name it something like speed-test-results.csv. 

For the information to output, be sure to include the date/time, the result, the SSID, the band, the megahertz, and anything else you can find that would be useful!
